      <h1>Who was Horus?</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>
        Horus was a main god in the early mythology of ancient Egypt. He
        represented a sky god/king god, as well as a war god, a world or light
        god and he was the protector of children. He was usually depicted as a
        falcon.<br /><br />The oldest being of the god Horus was that of a sky
        god, with the right eye being the so-called sun eye and the left eye the
        moon eye. Various myths surround both eyes. In his significance as the
        emblem of a victorious people, Horus became a war god and war-bringing
        leader, which gave rise to the belief that the king (pharaoh) was his
        earthly embodiment.<br /><br />Since that time, the kings of Egypt bore
        the falcon god Horus in their royal title. In later times, the Egyptians
        merged the sun Horus with the god of the same name from the Osiris cult
        to create one god Horus. However, this fusion process (syncretism) led
        to different results in different cult centers, so that there were
        ultimately fifteen different Horus gods.<br /><br />
        Accordingly Horus is the son of Osiris and Isis. He is locked in battle
        with Set, his uncle, who killed Horus' father, Osiris. He tries to
        avenge the murder of his father and becomes pharaoh. Therefore, every
        living pharaoh is equated with Horus: The respective pharaoh is Horus,
        i.e. a god.<br /><br />According to myth, Osiris was the first pharaoh
        and the one who unified Egypt. He was directly related to the gods, his
        bloodline stretching back to the creator god Atum. Osiris ruled Egypt
        together with the goddess Isis, his wife, and their rule ensured that
        balance and justice (Ma'at) were maintained.<br /><br />In his left
        hand, Horus holds an "ankh" (a symbol similar to a cross), the
        hieroglyph for the word "life" in the ancient Egyptian language.<br /><br />On
        the left side you see the symbol of "The Eye of Horus".<br /><br />In
        modern Egypt, too, a connection to Horus is very popular, probably due
        to the Muslim Arabs' appreciation of hunting falcons. The national
        airline Egypt Air has Horus as its signet and logo, and the business
        class was formerly called Horus Class. Ships travelling on the Nile have
        the Eye of Horus painted on both sides of the bow to ward off bad luck.

            <br />He was born by Isis during the month of Ka-her-ka
            (October/November). The depiction of Isis suckling Horus would later
            inspire the Coptic Christian iconography of the Virgin and Child.

            There is no mention of the god Horus ever dying in Egyptian
            mythology; as a god he is immortal and therefore without end.
            However, practically speaking, it could be said that Horus died when
            those who worshiped him stopped doing so, or when Ancient Egypt was
            annexed by the Romans in 30 BC.<br />Horus was later identified by
            the Greeks with Apollo, and the town of Idfū was called
            Apollinopolis (“Apollo’s Town”) during the Greco-Roman period.
