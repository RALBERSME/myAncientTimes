        In Egyptian mythology there were about 1,500 gods. The most important
        gods in ancient Egypt (3032 BC to 395 AD) were:<br /><br />

        <strong class="emphasis">Ra (Re)</strong> - the sun god<br />The
        earliest gods, Ra and/or Atum (both creator/sun gods), arose from a
        chaotic state of the world and gave birth to Shu (air) and Tefnut
        (moisture), whose union gave birth to Geb (earth) and Nut (sky), who in
        turn created Osiris, Isis, Set and Nephthys. In his human form, Ra is
        usually depicted as a falcon-headed man wearing a red disk on his head,
        representing the sun that Ra created at the beginning of the world.<br /><br /><a

        <strong class="emphasis">Osiris</strong> - the god of the underworld and
        judge of the dead. He was therefore the god of the afterlife and judge
        of the court of the dead. He was the brother of Seth, Nephthys and Isis.
        His main task was to decide as judge of the court of the dead whether
        the dead were allowed to enter the afterlife. The body of Osiris is
        usually depicted as a mummy, on his head he wears a crown with a feather
        on each side. In his hands he holds the royal symbols of a crosier and a
        fan. According to the myth, Osiris was killed by his brother Seth out of
        jealousy. Seth dismembered the body and scattered it all over Egypt. His
        sister-wife Isis found its individual parts, put it back together and
        brought it back to life <br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        <strong class="emphasis">Isis</strong> - the goddess of birth; she is
        the sister and wife of Osiris. She was the goddess of birth, rebirth and
        magic. In the Greco-Roman cult at the latest, she also became the
        mistress of the underworld, who was involved in rites for the
        dead.Osiris and Isis are twins who fell in love in the womb and grew up
        as a "couple whose love surpasses all understanding." But a jealous
        brother murdered Osiris and dismembered his body into 14 pieces. Isis
        succeeds in saving her beloved Osiris, at least for the afterlife, where
        he is given a new task. He becomes the king of the underworld, called
        "Duat" in Egyptian mythology, and the ruler of the blessed dead. Isis is
        depicted in human form as a woman. On her head she carries a throne -
        the hieroglyph of her name. In many depictions her headdress also
        consists of a cow's horn with a sun disk. <br /><br />

        <hr id="horus" />
        <br /><br />
        <strong class="emphasis">Horus</strong> - the lord of the world; he is
        the son of Osiris and Isis. In the early days of ancient Egyptian
        religion, Horus was considered the god of war and the sky and was
        married to the goddess Hathor. As the religion developed, Horus was seen
        as the son of Osiris and Isis and as the opponent of Seth. He channels
        enormous amounts of solar energy through his ankh talisman or bladed
        staff. His left eye, known as the "Eye of Horus," can paralyze those in
        his immediate vicinity. Horus can also take the physical form of a
        falcon or a falcon-headed humanoid. According to Egyptian mythology,
        Horus lost his left eye in battle with Seth. The eye was magically
        restored by Hathor, and this restoration symbolized the process of
        restoration and healing. For this reason, the symbol was often used in
        amulets.<br /><br />
        <hr id="seth" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong class="emphasis">Seth</strong> - the desert god and companion of
        Osiris.<br />Seth (also Set, Setech, Sutech; variant Wedja) is an
        ambivalent ancient Egyptian deity whose meaning is not entirely clear.
        Seth is a desert god and is associated with storms and bad weather,
        which is why he is considered the god of chaos and destruction.In other
        words he was the god of violence, chaos and confusion, the evil god who
        also embodied anger, rage, violence and murder. He was a trickster, a
        sky god, lord of the desert and master of storms, disorder and war. He
        was the brother of Osiris, whom he killed, and he was an opponent of
        Horus, the child of Osiris' sister Isis.<br /><br /><a

        <br /><br />
        <strong class="emphasis">Anubis</strong>, like Osiris, was one of the
        gods of the dead. He was part of the court of the dead and was
        responsible for mummification and conducting funeral rites. He was
        closely connected to Osiris and was even portrayed as his son in some
        myths. Anubis is mainly depicted as a lying black dog, jackal or as a
        human with a dog or jackal head. He usually carries a was-scepter and an
        ankh. Rarely, he is also depicted with a ram's head. In ancient Egypt,
        animals were highly valued because they were considered a connection to
        the divine sphere.<br /><br />
