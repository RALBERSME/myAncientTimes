      <h1>The 12 Temples of the Female Mystery School:</h1>
      <h2>
        The Left Eye of Horus was the female mystery school where the human
        nature of emotions and feelings, the chakras, sexual energy and
        childbirth, death, psychic energies and everything that is not logical
        was explored. Most Egyptian temples were built along the Nile for the
        training of the "Left Eye of Horus". Since one year was spent in each of
        these temples, the initiation therefore lasts 12 years.
