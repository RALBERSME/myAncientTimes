        Originally the god-king of Egypt, Osiris was killed and dismembered by
        his brother Seth. His sister and wife Isis, however, collected the
        pieces of the corpse that were scattered across the country and put them
        back together.

      Osiris, son of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Geb, lives as a king
      among men. He teaches them agriculture and the laws. Isis is his sister
      and wife. She is at his side and protects him. Seth, also son of the sky
      goddess Nut, is jealous of his brother Osiris. He plans an attack. Seventy
      co-conspirators are invited as guests to a drinking party, to which Osiris
      also appears. There, a coffin has been made to Osiris' measurements,
      without Osiris knowing about it. A game is announced, apparently in jest.
      Everyone should lie in the coffin, and whoever fits exactly in it can take
      it home as a gift. After it turns out that all the guests are either too
      big or too small, Osiris tries the coffin. The trap snaps shut. The coffin
      is closed and hot lead is poured into the interior through openings. Then
      the coffin is thrown into the Nile, where it drifts into the
      Mediterranean.

      When Isis learns of the plot to murder her husband and brother, she
      desperately sets out to search for it. Finally, she learns that the coffin
      was washed ashore on the Lebanese coast. There it got caught in a tree
      that grew around the coffin and thus protected it. Fate leads Isis
      indirectly to the large tree in which Osiris' coffin is hidden. The tree
      is cut off and the coffin is brought to Egypt, where Isis opens it.
      Osiris' body is still intact. But in Isis's absence, Seth sneaks up to the
      coffin and cuts Osiris' body into fourteen pieces and scatters them all
      over Egypt.<br />
      <br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      After Isis returns and realizes the situation, she immediately sets out to
      search for Osiris' body parts. With the help of the jackal-headed god of
      the dead, Anubis, she finds the body parts and puts them back together
      thanks to her magical powers. Then she transforms herself into a bird and
      sits on the phallus of the lying Osiris. This is how the son of the gods,
      Horus, is conceived (although according to Plutarch, Horus already existed
      beforehand). After the successful revival of Osiris and the conception of
      Horus, Osiris is allowed to rule as king again at the behest of the
      assembly of the gods. With one restriction: he is only allowed to rule in
      the underworld, as ruler of the realm of the dead.
      <br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      Growing up in the reed thickets of the Delta, the son of Isis and Osris,
      Horus, becomes a man. He takes on his father's adversary Seth as an
      avenger. They fight for a long time. But no matter how successful Horus
      may be in battle, Seth always recovers from his wounds and the battle
      ensues again. Ultimately, a tribunal of the gods must decide. Most of the
      gods support Horus and want him to be crowned king of Egypt, symbolically
      expressed with the "Eye of Horus".
      <br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      After tough negotiations, an official duel between Horus and Seth is
      scheduled. Seth suggests that they transform themselves into hippos and
      compete in a diving competition. The first to surface is the loser.
      Fearing that Seth could kill Horus in this duel, Isis intervenes. She
      wants to throw a harpoon at Seth, but instead it hits her own son Horus.
      But the harpoon lets go of him and she throws it a second time. This time
      it hits Seth. But Seth implores her to let go, since he is her brother.
      This time, too, the harpoon is let go. But Horus is furious and, in anger,
      cuts off his mother's head. The gods, especially the sun god Re-Harakhte,
      are outraged and begin to search for him. Seth finds Horus and tears his
      eyeballs out of their sockets and buries them. Then Seth lies to the gods
      and claims that he has not found Horus. But the goddess Hathor finds
      Horus. She puts gazelle milk into Horus' empty eye sockets. This creates
      new eyes and Horus can see again.<br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      The incident is reported to the gods. It is decided that the two gods
      should finally give up and make peace so that the argument can end. Seth
      agrees and offers a reconciliatory friendly feast. But when Horus has
      fallen asleep, Seth wants to rape Horus and thus humiliate him. But the
      sperm sticks between Horus' legs. When Horus wakes up, he reaches between
      his legs and finds traces of Seth's sperm. Horus is horrified and reports
      this to his mother Isis (who seems to have come to her senses again). She
      immediately cuts off his semen-smeared hand and throws it into the water
      of a lake. She has a plan for revenge. Isis tells Horus to masturbate and
      collects his sperm. Then she goes to Seth's vegetable garden and puts
      Horus' sperm on Seth's lettuce. By eating this lettuce, Seth becomes
      pregnant by Horus, and his revenge is complete. Seth does not yet know of
      his fate and drags him before the assembly of the gods. He boasts of
      having raped Horus - which in this cultural context is seen as a disgrace
      for the victim and not the perpetrator - and the gods insult Horus. But
      Horus defends himself. They should call on the seed of both gods and wait
      to see where they would answer from. They call on the seed of Horus, they
      call on the seed of Seth. The seed of Seth answers from the lake into
      which Isis threw Horus's severed hand. But the seed of Horus answers from
      Seth's head, from whose crown a golden sun disk grows.
      <br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      Thus Horus' honor is saved and Seth is exposed. He becomes angry and wants
      another race. This time it is to be a race with stone messengers. But
      Horus tricks. He builds a wooden boat that he coats with plaster so that
      it looks like it is made of stone. Seth's boat is actually made of stone.
      During the race, Seth's boat sinks. Horus wins. Seth turns into an angry
      hippopotamus and attacks Horus' boat. But Horus defends himself. He throws
      a harpoon at the hippopotamus that Seth has turned into. The gods call for
      a halt, and endless negotiations and meetings of the gods ensue again.
      Letters are exchanged between the highest gods to discuss the case, but
      Osiris and Re-Harakhte discuss in their correspondence instead who has a
      greater influence on the future of the world. Finally, it is decided that
      Horus should take over the kingship that once lay in the hands of Osiris.
      Seth should instead rule in the sky as the god of thunder and storms. In
      the end, the world of the gods is happy that a decision has been made and
      peace has come.<br />

      The myth has a direct connection to the reality of rule in Egypt. When
      each king takes office, the pharaoh takes on the role of Horus as ruler on
      earth. The deceased king, however, becomes Osiris. The desert and the
      foreign lands, on the other hand, are called the lands of Seth.
