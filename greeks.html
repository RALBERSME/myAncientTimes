      <h1>The Greeks, the Romans and Ancient Egypt</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Ancient Greece and ancient Egypt maintained trade relations that can be
        traced back to the time of the Minoan culture of the Bronze Age. Greeks
        had been present in Egypt since at least the 7th century BC. In the 7th
        century BC, after the Greek Dark Age from 1100 to 750 BC, the city of
        Naukratis was founded on the Nile in ancient Egypt. It was the first
        and, for much of its early history, the only permanent Greek colony in
        Egypt and acted as a hub for the exchange of Greek and Egyptian art and
        culture. The port of Herakleion served as the main seaport for
        Greco-Egyptian trade. Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in an early
        phase of his conquests in 331 BC. He respected the pharaonic religions
        and customs and became pharaoh.<br /><br />
        Alexander founded the city of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast,
        which was to be the capital of Egypt for centuries. After his death in
        323 BC, his empire was divided among the Diadochi. Egypt passed to
        Ptolemy I Soter, whose descendants founded a Greco-Macedonian royal
        dynasty of Egypt. Ptolemy gave additional legitimacy to his rule in
        Egypt by acquiring Alexander's body. He intercepted the embalmed body on
        its way to burial, brought it to Egypt, and placed it in a golden coffin
        in Alexandria. This remained one of the city's famous sights for many
        years until it was probably destroyed in the 3rd century. The Ptolemaic
        dynasty consisted entirely of ethnic Greeks and produced famous members
        such as Cleopatra VII. Alexandria became the center of the Greek and
        Hellenistic world under the Ptolemies and the center of international
        trade, art and science. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was one of the
        Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the Library of Alexandria was
        the largest library in the world during the reign of Ptolemy II
        Philadelphus. After the conquest of Egypt by the Roman Empire, Greek
        influence in Egypt remained large and a Greco-Roman elite ruled over the
        Egyptian population.<br /><br />After the division of the empire in 395,
        Egypt remained under the influence of the Greek-influenced Eastern Roman
        or Byzantine Empire until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the 7th century.
        With the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries, both
        Greece and Egypt came under Ottoman control. Greek culture and political
        influence continued during this period and perhaps even reached one of
        its peaks during the Ottoman rule in Egypt, when many Ottoman governors
        and pashas of Greek descent ruled Egypt. In 146 BC, Greece fell to the
        Roman Empire. This ended the political history of independent Greece for
        almost two millennia.<br /><br />

        The Greeks thus adopted a lot of Egyptian culture and even sent some of
        their philosophers to Egyptian mystery schools.<br /><br />
        Quote from wikipedia: <br /><br /><em
          >«Several of the ancient Greek philosophers regarded Egypt as a place
          of wisdom and philosophy. Isocrates (b. 436 BC) states in Busiris that
          "all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life
          among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy's
          training, a pursuit which has the power, not only to establish laws,
          but also to investigate the nature of the universe. "[10] He declares
          that Greek writers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge. One of them
          was Pythagoras of Samos who "was first to bring to the Greeks all
          philosophy," according to Isocrates. <br /><br />
          Plato states in Phaedrus that the Egyptian Thoth "invented numbers and
          arithmetic... and, most important of all, letters.”[11] In Plato's
          Timaeus, Socrates quotes the ancient Egyptian wise men when the
          law-giver Solon travels to Egypt to learn: "O Solon, Solon, you Greeks
          are always children."[12] Aristotle attests to Egypt being the
          original land of wisdom, as when he states in Politics that "Egyptians
          are reputed to be the oldest of nations, but they have always had laws
          and a political system.»</em

        <h2>
          <u>Conclusion:</u><br /><br />
          The Greeks and Romans adopted a lot from ancient Egypt, they admired
          the old culture and were interested in its science and technology, but
          also its mysticism. In the center of St. Peter's Square, for example,
          there is a 4000-year-old obelisk. This comes from the ancient Egyptian
          city of Heliopolis and symbolizes the victory over the heretics. It
          was shipped to Rome by Emperor Caligula and erected in 1586 under Pope
          Sixtus V. Some people today therefore claim that the Christian
          religion is also based on the basic ideas of the ancient Egyptians.
          Whether this is the case is debatable and not proven. If you are
          interested in the topic, do your own research.
