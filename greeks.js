                Aristotle spent some twenty years advancing his education in
                Egypt until the invasion of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, when
                Aristotle got the opportunity he had been praying for, to
                ransack leading Egyptian libraries and carry off all the books

              He was a leader in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics,

              Plato studied in Egypt for years. He spent months studying
              arithmetic, music and number theory, as well as astronomy with the
              temple priests in Memphis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The knowledge gained from Egypt is also evident in his later work
              on music theory (table in the “Nomoi” (Laws)). Friedrich Wilhelm
              Korff investigated the Egyptian measurement and measurement
              system, which had been introduced by the architect Imhotep under
              Pharaoh Djoser around 2635 BC, and found that the cubit and
              handbreadth measurements were only made up of the products of the
              first five prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7), just like Plato's 60
              parts of the number 5040 in the table of Nomoi, because 5040 or
              factorial of seven (7!) is equal to the product of the first seven
              natural numbers (1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 = 5040). "Korff
              suspected that Plato's table contained a pyramid builder's rule
              and this was confirmed when he examined the dimensions of 29 large
              pyramids in the manuals on pyramid construction and found that the
              bases were almost always whole numbers, formed from the products
              of these same numbers.<br />The unity of the fields of knowledge
              arithmetic, geometry and music theory were probably crucial for
              the buildings in ancient Egypt.<br />Source & for additional

              Around seven hundred years or so after Pythagoras’s death, the
              early Christian writer Klemes of Alexandria (lived c. 150 – c. 215
              CE) wrote a miscellaneous philosophical work titled Stromata.
              Klemes makes several noteworthy statements about Pythagoras: “And
              Pythagoras is reported to have been a disciple of Sonches the
              Egyptian arch-prophet".<br />Diogenes Laërtios, the Phoinikian
              Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyrios of Tyre (lived c. 234 – c. 305
              CE) wrote his own biography of Pythagoras He repeats the classic
              stories about Pythagoras studying philosophy with the Egyptians,
              Chaldaians, and Magoi, but adds the additional claim that
              Pythagoras also studied among the Phoinikians. Source & for

              Thales was considered one of the Seven Sages and the founder of
              ancient natural philosophy, astronomy and geometry.

              Several ancient authors assume that Thales, at one point in his
              life, visited Egypt, where he learned about geometry. It is
              considered possible that Thales visited Egypt, since Miletus had a
              permanent colony there (namely Naucratis). It is also said Thales
              had close contacts with the priests of Thebes who instructed him,
              or even that he instructed them in geometry. It is also possible
              Thales knew about Egypt from accounts of others, without actually
              visiting it.Source & for additional reading:

               As a philosopher, he was the last significant representative of the younger Stoicism. Freedom and justice, especially in the sense of equal rights for all, were among the political principles that Marcus Aurelius acquired early on and always propagated. According to his own statement, what was important to him was a rational and common good-oriented use of power in the Hellenistic philosophical tradition, which took into account the limits of its own competence and gave priority to greater expertise or delegated the problem-solving. </p>

                <strong>Among his inner circle was Arnuphis (ca. 174 AD), an Egyptian general believed to have magical powers</strong>, who saved Marcus Aurelius' army from defeat by the Quadi (a Germanic tribe) when they were trapped in a pass blocked by the enemy. According to the writer Dio Cassius, Aurelius' troops were dying of thirst when Arnuphis conjured up a miraculous storm that confused the enemy and allowed the Romans to quench their thirst and win the battle. Their triumph became known as "The Miracle of the Thundering Legion," although Christians attributed the victory to their own prayers rather than to the help of Mercury and other gods invoked by Arnuphis.
