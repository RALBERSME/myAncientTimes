      <h1>Many questions about ancient Egypt remain unanswered</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>
        Look, you are not the only one who has a lot of things that remain a
        mystery. Even the wisest people have not been able to solve every
        mystery. Despite the long history of research, there are still MANY
        unanswered questions about Ancient Egypt. The main question remains
        unchanged:<br /><br />
        <strong><em>« How were the giant pyramids built? »</em></strong>
        <br /><br />
        But there are still further questions, e.g.:<br />

        <br />

        Where is the tomb of Nefertiti?<br /><br />Tutankhamun died with a
        fractured skull and a broken knee. What happened to him?<br /><br />Dozens
        of written records mention the land of Punt, but to this day no one
        knows where this land was located. Punt is often portrayed as a powerful
        African kingdom that existed somewhere in the south alongside the
        Egyptians. The Egyptians obviously respected and revered this kingdom
        and even called it "God's Land". But where can you find it?<br /><br />There
        is a considerable amount of archaeological and historical evidence to
        suggest that a huge labyrinth once stretched out near the pyramids. The
        Greek historian and geographer Herodotus also mentioned a huge labyrinth
        near the pyramids during his visit to Egypt in the 4th century BC. Does
        it really exist? And if so, how could one find it?<br /><br />The
        Pyramid of Djedefre was supposedly the most impressive pyramid ever
        built. Some historians even claim that it could have been as large as
        one of the pyramids at Giza. The Pyramid of Djedefre was destroyed for
        unknown reasons. Why? What happened?
        <br />
        Some believe that the Romans used the pyramid's stone for their own
        infrastructure projects, while others believe that there may have been a
        revolt by the Egyptian people against Djedfre and they destroyed his
        monument out of malice. But is this true?<br /><br />In 2015,
        archaeologists were able to uncover the tomb of an unknown woman who was
        buried sometime during the Old Kingdom, about 4,500 years ago. The
        hieroglyphs on her sarcophagus describe her as both the "mother" and
        "wife" of the king.
        <br />
        A closer look reveals that she may have been one of the most important
        female figures of ancient Egypt, but aside from the discovery of the
        tomb, it's a complete mystery. So who was she?<br /><br />In 2017,
        researchers studied the largest pyramid, Cheops, and their findings were
        simply incredible. In addition to the three chambers discovered in
        previous years, there was a much larger hidden chamber at the base of
        the pyramid. The chamber has no paths or known entrances. What was it
        for? Why was it created?<br /><br />The origin of the Sphinx is
        completely unknown. It was once thought that the Egyptians built the
        Sphinx like the pyramids, but this may not be correct.
        <br />
        Water erosion on the base of the statue dates the Sphinx to around 7000
        BC. This would suggest that either ancient Egypt is much older than
        initially thought or that an earlier, equally advanced civilization
        built the Sphinx. Who built the Sphinx, when, and for what purpose?<br />
        <br />The Dendera Light is an enigmatic inscription carved into the
        walls of a temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Hathor. The image
        appears to depict either the use or instructions for making a Crookes
        tube, an item used as a light bulb in the 19th century. Had the
        Egyptians already developed a simple form of electricity?<br /><br />
